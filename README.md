# I Read Dead People

_I Read Dead People_ is an event taking place at the Acreage Branch Library on October 27th, where guests will be invited to interact with gothic, horror, and sci-fi writers who have moved beyond the veil. 

As part of the event, I am contributing some environmental goodies in the form of physical installations and eerie props! Here's what we have going on.

# The Props
## Mary Shelley: Mother of Horror

A portrait to revere the beloved creator of _Frankenstein._ Greet her on your way into the event. When your friends come, you can point her out--wait, were her eyes always like that?

This is a work in progress. Here's what the prototype is currently looking like, as of 10/11:

I assembled this using:

* A portrait of Mary Shelley
* An X-Acto knife to cut out her eyes
* A bookstand, to keep the portrait standing
* A servo motor
* An Arduino Uno
* A paperclip
* A binder clip
* A small piece of cardstock
* A second bookstand to support the servo motor
* Lots of tape
* Jumper cables

Once I'm satisfied with the final product, I'll post a Fritzing to reflect the wiring scheme. 

## The Birds

Daphne du Maurier and Edgar Allen Poe will be making appearances, so what would this event be without birds that shriek as you approach?

I gutted the biggest crow, and hid a STEMMA speaker, an Arduino Nano, and a battery pack inside.

I am also planning to dress the part as a guide for our dearly departed guests. I have this gorgeous black feathered wings that may be incorporated as part of a _Hermes_ vibe.
